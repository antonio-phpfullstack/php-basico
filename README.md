# PHP - Basics

## Objective of this repository

**Here is a little story:** In my first job, I always arrived early. I sat in my chair, turned on the computer (that old 
one), typed the OS login password, and started working. After several months, the unexpected happened: I simply forgot 
the password. The password was stored in the webmail, which was accessible upon starting the computer. This incident 
taught me a few things:

- Never overestimate your ability to learn
- Never underestimate your ability to forget

This repository covers the basics of PHP syntax. If you are new to PHP and want to learn this amazing programming 
language, keep in mind that forgetting is an inherent part of learning. Good luck!
